# Analysis-and-Prediction-of-NYC-Crime-Data

## Description
This paper aims to predict patterns of crime type in New York City by building various machine learning models, including Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Logistic Regression.

2. Crime_Preprocessing.ipynb- the data preprocessing step
3. Crime_EDA.ipynb-the EDA(Exploratary data analysis) step is in the Crime_EDA.ipynb
4. Classification method.ipynb- the final modeling and evaluation process

## Highlights
1. Conduct a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to unveil patterns and insights into crime in NYC.
2. Enhance the dataset by merging it with holiday data, thereby incorporating additional features for a more comprehensive analysis.
3. Perform a comprehensive comparison of classification models, including Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Logistic Regression.
4. Employ robust evaluation methods, such as classification reports and confusion matrices, to assess model performance accurately.
